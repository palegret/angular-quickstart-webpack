# angular-quickstart-webpack
Same code as the QuickStart app on angular.io, using webpack instead of SystemJS. 

*Note: this project was created following the tutorial, not by forking the angular/quickstart repo, and so lacks some of the added concerns related to testing, etc. I may add those on later.*
